{"key": "The image displays a graph showing the relationship between training loss and training epochs. The graph is a line graph with the x-axis representing the number of epochs and the y-axis showing the training loss. The line on the graph represents the training loss as a function of the number of epochs. The graph provides a visual representation of the training process, showing how the loss decreases as the number of epochs increases.</s>"}
